# ethgastable

Welcome! This repo hosts the front-end for ethgastable.info, a simplified table of EVM opcode/precompile prices.

This project was inspired by Danny Ryan's table [here](https://github.com/djrtwo/evm-opcode-gas-costs). Most of the current data comes from that repo.

Feel free to make issues or pull requests if you spot something wrong! I'll try to keep this updated as things change.
